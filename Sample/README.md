# MapLayr Sample

This sample demonstrates how to use MapLayr in an iOS app. It includes code to:

- Initialise a `Map` and `MapView`
- Add a user location marker which tracks the user's location
- Add some interactive annotations
- Calculate and display routes from the user's location to a destination
- Move the camera

Set your location to or near **52.897, -1.8478** to see the user's location on the map. Tap on an annotation to get directions from the user's location to the selected annotation.

All of the interaction with the Maps SDK takes place in [`ViewController.swift`](Sources/ViewController.swift).
