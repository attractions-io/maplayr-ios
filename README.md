## Features

**Routing** — Help guests find their way from A to B effortlessly with MapLayr’s custom routing. Calculate walking distances, create dedicated routes for guests with accessibility needs, and find the nearest entrance to buildings or activities from anywhere on your map.

**Dynamic Lighting** — Enhance map immersion with dynamic lighting and environmental effects, such as shimmering water reflections and ambient evening moonlight.

**Camera** — Supports user gestures for panning, zooming, rotating and tilting. Programmatically control the camera position, or enable follow mode to keep the camera centred on the user location marker.

**Annotations** — Display interactive annotations by passing in objects and defining how they appear on the map. Use the built-in annotation style, or customise to match your app's design and logic.

**Multi-level** — Visualise multiple floors of a building with levels stacked in a 3D view. Provide controls to allow users to toggle between floors.
